# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Analysis and Visualization of Agricultural Data based on the impact of Climate Change through ETL process.


## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->

1. What impact has climate change had on crop production in countries around the world in the last decadess? Have there been any trends or recurring patterns, in crop yields?

2. What is the part played by temperature variations in influencing the growth and yield of major crops in India, Pakistan and Germany?

3. What effect did changes in rainfall patterns have on agricultural productivity and crop yields in Germany, India and Pakistan?

4. Are there any considerable shifts in the geographical crops distribution as a result of changes in climatic conditions?

5. How do the variations in temperature and rainfall impact how well pesticides work across different parts of the world?

6. What steps are farmers and communities taking to protect crops from the effects of climate change and ensure they can still grow healthy?

7. How are advancements in technology and data analytics being utilized to monitor and predict the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity?

8. How are we using technology and data analytics to keep an eye on how climate change affects crop productivity?


## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->

Climate change implies significant challenges to agricultural productivity worldwide, impacting crop yields. Nevertheless, understanding the complex relation between climate and agricultural data remains a barrier, which needs an efficient data analysis and visualization framework. For this purpose, the objective of this project is to build an ETL pipeline to assess or measure the impact of climate change on agricultural data and provide necassary valuable insights. The pipeline will collect various public datasets including historical climate data such as temperature and rainfall, different crops yield records, pesticide usage, and geographic information. The extracted data will undergo several transformations to standardize formats, clean outliers, and integrate relevant variables. Accordingly, the loaded data will be analyzed using statistical techniques to identify trends, correlations, irregularity caused by climate change effects on crop yield variability and pesticide requirements. The time series plots, heatmaps, and geographical maps as visualization techniques is utilized to effectively provide insights and patterns derived from the analysis. This framework will empower policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders on how to handle the difficulties arising from climate change in agriculture by providing them with well-informed decision-making capabilities.
